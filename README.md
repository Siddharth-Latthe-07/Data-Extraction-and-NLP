# Data-Extraction-and-NLP
#### 1. The objective of this assignment is to extract textual data articles from the given URL and perform text analysis to compute variables
#### 2. Steps:- 
         a.) Load the input data
         b.) With the help of beautiful soup library extract the context from the URL and save the same as {URI_ID}.txt
         c.) Now, we will convert the context from the URI into strings and stored it in the table
         d.) Then perform data cleaning by removing stop words
         e.) Import the positive and negative words.txt file for comparing the results and convert them to tokens as required for analysis.
         f.) Further, we import the nltk module for performing sentiment analysis on each string that we have stored and based on the words matching from the master dictionary folder we will increment the scores accordingly
